# Laptop-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
EDA on Laptop Features and Pricing Dataset

## Dataset Description:
This dataset contains detailed information about laptops, including their specifications, pricing, and other relevant features. The goal is to analyze the dataset to uncover insights about product pricing and specifications.

## Dataset Columns:

Company: Name of the laptop manufacturer.

Product: Model name of the laptop.

TypeName: Category/type of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Gaming, Notebook).

Inches: Screen size in inches.

Ram: Size of the RAM in GB.

OS: Operating system installed on the laptop.

Weight: Weight of the laptop in kg.

Price_euros: Price of the laptop in Euros.

Screen: Screen resolution description.

ScreenW: Screen width in pixels.

ScreenH: Screen height in pixels.

Touchscreen: Indicates if the laptop has a touchscreen (Yes/No).

IPSpanel: Indicates if the laptop has an IPS panel (Yes/No).

RetinaDisplay: Indicates if the laptop has a Retina display (Yes/No).

CPU_company: Manufacturer of the CPU (e.g., Intel, AMD).

CPU_freq: Frequency of the CPU in GHz.

CPU_model: Model of the CPU.

PrimaryStorage: Capacity of primary storage (e.g., SSD/HDD) in GB.

SecondaryStorage: Capacity of secondary storage in GB.

PrimaryStorageType: Type of primary storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).

SecondaryStorageType: Type of secondary storage.

GPU_company: Manufacturer of the GPU.

GPU_model: Model of the GPU.

## Key Suggestions Based on Analysis:

Optimize Screen Size and Weight: Manufacturers can focus on laptops with popular screen sizes (e.g., 15 inches) and lighter weights to attract more customers.

High RAM Models: Increasing RAM capacity in laptops correlates with higher pricing, suggesting a potential premium market.

Touchscreen and IPS Panels: These features are highly sought-after and justify higher pricing, so manufacturers should prioritize including them.

CPU and GPU Improvements: Collaboration with leading CPU and GPU companies can significantly boost product performance and perceived value.

Product Segmentation: Laptops with Retina displays and advanced screen resolutions can target the premium customer segment.
